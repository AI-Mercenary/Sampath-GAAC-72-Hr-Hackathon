# Video Summarization Using Temporal Attention

## Overview
This project addresses the problem of efficiently summarizing long-form videos (lectures, documentaries, sports, etc.) into concise, representative clips. By leveraging temporal attention mechanisms, the system identifies and extracts key moments from videos automatically, resulting in summaries under 10% of the original video length. To enhance accuracy, the solution integrates audio and text metadata in its processing pipeline.
